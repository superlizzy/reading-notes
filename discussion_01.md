## 01 - Learning Markdown

#### Reading Notes

**Markdown** is a quick and easy way to format text for the web without taking the time to fully code your website with HTML. This allows you to focus on your **content**, not your ~~code~~.

# **Content** --> ~~Code~~

Markdown is supported on GitHub, as well as any file that ends in .md (which stands for "Markdown").

There is a lot you can do with Markdown, but here are the basics to get you started on GitHub:

Style | Syntax | Example | Output
