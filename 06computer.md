# 06 - How do computers work?

For something to be a computer, it must do the following:

1. Input
2. Storage
3. Processing
4. Output

### Input

Input is any kind of data, and can be received through a keyboard, microphone, camera, network, etc.

Computers use a coding language called **binary**, where all data is converted into a series of 0's and 1's. Programmers do not program in binary any more, but computers still use it in the background.

### Storage

Input is stored in storage, or **memory**. Oftentimes, data goes back and forth between storage and processing before it is outputted.

### Processing

Processing happens in the Central Processing Unit, or **CPU**. Modern computers have several CPU's in order to process multiple pieces of information simultaneously.

**Algorithms**, or series of commands, are used to process data. This data is then stored again in the memory before it is eventually outputted.

### Output

One the data has been processed, it can be outputted in several different ways. For desktop or laptop computers, a common output would be pixels on the monitor. Other forms of output may use a printer, a 3D printer, a robot, etc.

### Hardware and Software

**Hardware** is the physical parts of your computer.

**Software** is the nontangible code that comes together to create a program, app, website, etc.

An **Operating System** is what is used for your hardware to communicate with your software. Common operating systems are Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
