What they do: | Assign a value to a variable. | Perform basic math. | Combine two strings.
Example: | `color = 'beige';` | `area = 3 * 2;` | `greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';`
Result: | The value of color is now beige. | The value of area is now 6. | The value of greeting is now Hi Molly.

#### Arithmetic Operators
Beyond the basics like +, -, *, and /, JavaScript also uses the following arithmetic operators:

- ++ Adds one to the current number
- -- Subtracts one from the current number
- % Devides two values and returns the remainder

JavaScript Arithmetic Operators follow the same order of execution as any other math.

#### String Operators
The only string operator is `+`, which is used to join the strings on either side of it.

> **_Vocab Alert!!_**

>> **Concatenation** (noun) The joining of two or more variables.

### Functions

A function is a block of JavaScript code that can be called at any time, and repeatedly. The block of code is contained within curly brackets `{}`, and there is **no semicolon** after the last bracket.
