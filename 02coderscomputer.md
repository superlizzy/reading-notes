## What is a Text Editor?

A **text editor** is what web developers use to write their code. There are many different kinds of text editors to choose from -- like Notepad, a basic text editor that comes installed on your PC, or VS Code, a third-party text editor with many features and addons. Each has different advantages and disadvantages depending on your tastes and needs, but most web developers prefer a third-party text editor with the following features:

1. **Code completion** - Closing tags and brackets automatically appear as you type, to ensure you never forget to close the section of code you're working on.
2. **Syntax highlighting** - Different types of code are given a different text color to easily distinguish between them.
3. **Themes** - You can change the background color and other visual settings of your code to reduce eye strain.
4. **Extensions** - You can download a variety of additional features for your third-party text editor that will make it easier for you to code.

Although there is no right or wrong answer to the question of, "Which text editor should I choose?," it's important to research the features and capabilities so you can code as quickly and accurately as possible.

## What is a Terminal?

A **terminal**, also called a **command line**, is a text-based program on your computer that allows you to talk to your computer and receive feedback. So what kinds of things can you "talk" to your computer about? Here's a quick list to get you going:

#### Terminal Cheat Sheet

Command | What it stands for | What it does
--------|--------------------|-------------
**pwd** | *Print Working Directory* | This will tell you what directory you're working in on your computer
**ls** | *List* | This will list out all the files and folders within your current directory.
**cd _[location]_** | *Change Directory* | Type the name of the folder you'd like to go to instead of **[location]**. For instance, if I wanted to go to my Documents folder, I would enter `cd Documents`
**file _[path]_** | *File Type* | View the file type of a certain file by indicating it instead of **[path]**. For instance, if I wanted to see the file type of "01.jpg" I would enter `file 01.jpg` while in that directory. OR, I could enter the full path from any directory, `file /home/Documents/01.jpg`
