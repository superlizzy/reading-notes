# Hi, I'm Liz.

**Bio:** I made my first Geocities website when I was 9 as a tribute to Hanson, the Backstreet Boys, and Britney Spears. I was the homeschooled daughter of a computer programmer with a lot of time on my hands, and I learned HTML using Microsoft FrontPage (and a lot of trial and error). When I was in my early teens, my parents bought me my first domain name for Christmas (soulfrog.com -- I no longer own it). This was before Facebook and MySpace, and blogging was new. My website was mainly a blog, with a big font collection available for download. I changed the layout constantly, and eventually used Notepad and an FTP client instead of FrontPage. I didn't know CSS, though, so when I changed the layout it involved editing every single page! Eventually I was introduced to the life-changing magic of Cascading Style Sheets, which made changing the design of my website *so much* easier.

In college I volunteered to create a website for a non-proft in Chicago, [GirlForward](http://girlforward.org) (they have since updated their website many times). I used this as an opportunity to push myself to learn WordPress, and I created a custom theme for that site. I have used WordPress as my go-to CMS ever since. These days I generally start with an existing, responsive theme that I can customize with CSS and plugins.
