# 06 - Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

### Separation of Concerns

Programmers use three different layers when creating a website.

CONTENT | PRESENTATION | BEHAVIOR
--------|--------------|---------
HTML | CSS | JavaScript
The `.html` file provides the structure and content. | The `.css` file provides visual style to the content. | The `.js` file provides interactivity to the content and style.

**It is best practice to keep your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in their own separate files**

### Comments

**Multi-Line Comments**

```
/* It is best practice to comment within your JavaScript code so that you and other developers can easily understand your code. Use this type of comment for multi-line comments. */
```

**Single-Line Comments**
```
var today = new Date();     // Single-line comment
```

String | The string data type handles letters and other characters. | **'Hi, Ivy!'**
