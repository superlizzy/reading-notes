# 03 - A-C-P

#### What is A-C-P?

When making changes to your cloned repository on your desktop, don't forget to **A-C-P** when you are ready to save and upload your changes!

1. **A**dd
2. **C**ommit
3. **P**ush

Command | What it does
--------|-------------
`git add [file]` | Adds the file you indicate to your list of files that will be included on your next commit (or save)
`git commit -m '[notes]'` | Commit (or save) your changes, and add your notes about WHY you made the change.
`git push` | Push (or publish) your changes to your repository in the cloud.

At any time, use the command `git status` to see what has changed since you last committed. If the file name is red, it needs to be added. If it is green, it has been added and will be committed and pushed when you type those commands.

**Remember:** If you are using VS Code, set it to autosave by ensuring "Autosave" is checked in your File menu. Then A-C-P to publish your changes to the web.
